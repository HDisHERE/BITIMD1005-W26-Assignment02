# Exercise 01 - HTML Fundamentals

Welcome to exercise 01 - this exercise covers HTML syntax, document structure, semantic elements, tables, and forms.

## Objective

Your task is to take the plain text content in `index.html` and wrap it with the appropriate HTML tags to create a properly structured webpage.

## Steps

1. Create a folder on your local machine to work in and open it up in VSCode
2. Create an `index.html` file in your local working folder
3. Copy the contents of the `index.html` file in this repository into your newly created `index.html` file
4. Using your knowledge of HTML, start wrapping the blocks of text in the `index.html` file with HTML tags
5. Your tasks include:
   - Setting up the proper HTML document structure (`<!DOCTYPE>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`)
   - Adding semantic elements (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`)
   - Using headings (`<h1>` - `<h3>`), paragraphs (`<p>`), and lists (`<ul>`, `<li>`)
   - Creating a table with proper structure (`<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, `<td>`)
   - Building a form with labels and inputs (`<form>`, `<label>`, `<input>`, `<select>`, `<textarea>`, `<button>`)
6. Use the screenshot below as a guide for how your finished page should look
7. If you get stuck, have a look inside the `\solution` folder for one way of completing this exercise

## Tips

- Remember that all HTML documents need a `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration at the very top
- Every `<html>` element should have a `lang` attribute
- The `<head>` section needs a `<meta charset="UTF-8">` and a `<title>`
- Use `<label>` elements with `for` attributes that match input `id` attributes
- Tables should have `<thead>` for header rows and `<tbody>` for data rows
